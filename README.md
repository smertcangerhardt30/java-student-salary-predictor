### 🎓 Student Future Salary Predictor (Java)

This project is a Java-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) simulation that models a student's profile and predicts their future starting salary based on their academic performance and scholarship status.

**Features:**
* Takes student details dynamically from the user via console input (ID, name, GPA, year of study, scholarship status).
* Uses conditional logic to format output with correct English ordinal suffixes (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th year).
* Predicts future salary for local (Turkey) and international (Abroad) scenarios based on a custom algorithm.
* Adjusts salary predictions dynamically based on the student's GPA and scholarship status.

**Tech Stack:**
* Java
* OOP Concepts (Classes, Objects, Methods)
* `java.util.Scanner` for console inputs
